Game Prototype: Axis of Awareness
5/6/2022

“The Bear went over the mountain, and what do you think he saw?
He saw another mountain, and what do you think he did?
He climbed that other mountain, and what do you think he saw?
He saw another mountain…(ad infinitum)”

	This is a game about breaking boundaries.  Specifically, this is a game about breaking boundaries the Player thinks are unbreakable.

	I’ve always loved imagining what’s beyond the limits of the games I’ve played.  Of course, games have boundaries by their nature.  Some of these boundaries are story driven – a sleeping Snorlax in Pokémon, for example – but others are defined by the limits of development time, computer specification targets, and other non-immersive elements of video games.  
	Take, as another example, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: a game so open that it reinvigorated the notion of the open-world RPG by showing the Player from the start: “This is your story, and you are free to unfold it however which way you choose.”  And yet - if you travel far enough north you will reach a chasm too wide to cross, and look out helplessly upon the lands beyond Hyrule.  Who wouldn’t wonder what could be out there?
	Another way of subverting the boundaries of a game world is creating a “game within a game.”  In Portal, you perform tests for a rogue AI, only to discover that the pristine, bright rooms aren’t the whole story as you bit-by-bit escape into the underbelly of Aperture Labs.  The moment you see a deer in the distance is possibly one of my favorites in all of video games.
	
	But, what if the rules of the “game within a game” are the same thing as the rules of the game itself?  In other words a Player plays, thinking they’re slowly but surely grasping the fundamentals of the game’s system, only for the game to pull the rug right out from under them – “This isn’t the whole picture, and the pieces you're missing change the essence of what the game is.”

	This is the sort of game I am seeking to prototype.  Using conventions found in games, storytelling, and modern media at-large to make the player themselves create boundaries that aren’t truly there, I can center gameplay on the joy of not just discovering something new, but learning as well.
	The game prototype as of now is the simplest example of subverting a convention that I could think of.  The player, a white, square-shaped sprite, is tasked with reaching a flag - that is on the other side of a wall made of white, diamond-shaped sprites.  My question for those who play is this: how long did it take to realize you are capable of walking straight through the wall to the flag?  Given that the player sprite and the wall are both white, I imagine that a Player will imagine both objects to be solid, and thus cannot occupy the same space in a game.  Thus, the “rules” the Player creates for themselves are not the actual rules of the game.
	The Player has learned something about the game, and this “learning” can also be engaged with directly in future iterations of levels - challenged, modified, confirmed, refuted, even outright ignored - in order to further flesh out the “rules” (or lack thereof) the Player imagines for themselves.

	As it stands, my game prototype is still rather fundamental.  From here, I will begin exploring new ways to implement this style of gameplay loop, further building off this initial first level.  Please look forward to it!
